//   --js-runtimes node   YouTube's n-challenge needs yt-dlp's EJS solver, and
//                        only Deno is enabled by default.
//   SSL_CERT_FILE        the static ffmpeg build serving --download-sections
//                        carries no CA bundle and exits 251 without it.
//   sleep after EVERY    including failures. A backlog that retried instantly
//   attempt              is what fed the throttle spiral that produced an
//                        "unavailable" pile on a sibling.
//   bot-check -> exit 2  a soft-fail here burns the whole run's remaining
//                        requests against a session that is already refusing.
//   -f bv*[height<=720]  video only, no audio stream fetched at all.
//
// The stamp is SIX digits of ABSOLUTE seconds, so a lexical sort of the frame

// the paths just written, which is what makes a denser second pass ADDITIVE
