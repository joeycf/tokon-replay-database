/**
 * ONE-OFF MIGRATION — backfill the badge label onto committed records.
 *
 * Engine v0.13.0 gave `Replay` an `event`, and buildTheaterRecords now sets it
 * on every NEW record. Committed records never regain a field on their own:
 * data/videos.json is merged add-only, so the records already in it would keep
 * printing the source's configured name forever while records ingested
 * tomorrow printed their event. This closes that gap once.
 *
 * WHERE THE TAG COMES FROM. Not the catalogue — `raw/` is gitignored and holds
 * at most the last cursor delta. It comes from the record's OWN title, which
 * fetch-theater synthesized as
 *
 *     <game> ▰ <p1> (<chars>) vs <p2> (<chars>) ▰ <tag>
 *
 * so the trailing slot is the tag verbatim. That is a derivation, so it is
 * gated rather than trusted: exactly 3 separator-delimited segments means
 * tagged, exactly 2 means untagged, and ANY other shape aborts the run.
 * Measured across every committed corpus on the platform before this was
 * written — theater titles are only ever 2 or 3 segments, and no tag contains
 * the separator. A 4-segment title would mean the grammar changed and the
 * derivation is no longer safe, so it stops rather than guessing.
 *
 * `channelName` is deliberately NOT backfilled. The uploader lives only in the
 * catalogue dump, this intake admits no untagged entry, and every committed
 * record here has a tag — so the field would render on nothing.
 *
 * WHAT IT PROVES BEFORE WRITING. Record count, id order, and byte-equality of
 * every record with the new keys stripped — the only difference anywhere in
 * the file is the presence of a new key. Plus the coverage counts, hard-coded:
 * a backfill that silently covers 60 of 69 looks exactly like one that worked.
 *
 * Run:  npx tsx scripts/backfill-source-label.ts          # dry run, reports
 *       npx tsx scripts/backfill-source-label.ts --write  # applies
