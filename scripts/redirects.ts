/**
 * Keep retired player URLs alive.
 *
 * Merging two spellings of one player deletes a page. Every player profile is
 * PRERENDERED and listed in sitemap.xml (nuxt.config.ts seeds the routes;
 * replay-engine/modules/static-artifacts.ts writes the sitemap), so a retired id
 * is an indexed URL that becomes a hard 404 — replay-engine's players/[id].vue
 * throws createError({ statusCode: 404 }) the moment the registry has no entry.
 *
 * There is no redirect layer anywhere on this platform. This is it.
 *
 * THE DESTINATION MUST BE RELATIVE. The shell rewrites /tokon/:path* to this
 * deployment (replay-database-shell/vercel.json), so an absolute destination
 * would answer a request for replaydatabase.com with a Location pointing at
 * tokon-replay-database.vercel.app and throw the visitor off the real site. A
 * leading-slash destination resolves against whatever origin the browser is on,
 * which is the shell's.
 *
 * MANUAL, not part of the cron. The retired set only changes when a person edits
 * scripts/players.ts, and vercel.json is build configuration — the daily data
 * commit has no business touching it.
 *
 * Run: npm run data:redirects        (--check to verify without writing)
